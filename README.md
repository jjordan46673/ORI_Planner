## A New hORIzon

I don't know about you, but I'm about as scatter-brained as it gets!
I'm constantly making a mess, I forget to feed myself, and I'm still waiting for Tile to make a glasses accessory.
Now I'm no scientologist: I can't fix your noggin, or mine for that matter.
However, I understand what it's like to feel a bit overwhelmed by life, and I made a little something to help.

## ORIginal Design

ORI Planner is designed for us scatter-brains.
Instead of a bORIng checklist, ORI divides our to-do lists into three parts:

- Sprints
- Tasks
- Goals

### Sprints: reORIent yourself every day

Sprints are goals set at the beginning of the day.
Ideally, while sipping your morning coffee, you can reflect on what you want to achieve by the day's end and record it in ORI.
It could be a responsibility, like you just remembered it's trash day, or you know the floor needs vacuumed before family arrives for dinner tonight.
It could also be a personal goal, such as hitting the gym or giving someone a compliment.
Think of Sprints like RUNNING towards a daily success.

### Tasks: priORItize efficiency over worry

Tasks are non-urgent responsibilities with a real deadline.
This is the most general function of a to-do app.
You can record future tasks such as Christmas shopping, getting an oil change for your car, or filing your taxes.
This app can also function as a calendar app, reminding you about doctor's appointments, lunch with friends, and important birthdays.
Think of Tasks like WALKING towards an eventual success.

### Goals: memORIes are made here

Goals are a little unique.
Instead of a single achievable item, Goals are meant to hold multiple Tasks and display them as a group.
This helps to make large, daunting tasks more manageable.
You can also use these goals to visualize the steps needed to achieve something great.
For example, hit your fitness goals by getting a gym membership, exercising thrice in a week (using Sprints to motivate yourself), and learning a new healthy recipe.
Think of Goals like HIKING.
It will take a lot of WALKING, but you'll eventually end up wherever you want to go.

## Roadmap

Current Task:

> Develop/Debug Goals (GoalTasks page)

To Completion:

- Build settings page
- Implement settings

Improvements

- Cannot add card without giving it a name
- Clearer that description is not required
- FAB disappears when scrolling down 
- Swipe between Sprints|Tasks|Goals

Bugs

- While card is expanded, if checked/unchecked, the card at its previous position inherits the open state, and the correct card loses it
- Motion lags for the first ~15 seconds, then smooths (development mode issue?)
