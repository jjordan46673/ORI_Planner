## A New hORIzon

I don't know about you, but I'm about as scatter-brained as it gets!
I'm constantly making a mess, I forget to feed myself, and I'm still waiting for Tile to make a glasses accessory.
Now I'm no scientologist: I can't fix your noggin, or mine for that matter.
However, I understand what it's like, and I made a little something to help.

## ORIginal Design

ORI Planner is designed for us scatter-brains.
Instead of a bORIng checklist, ORI divides our to-do lists into three parts:

- Sprints
- Tasks
- Goals

### Sprints: reORIent

Sprints are daily goals set at the beginning of the day.
Ideally, while sipping your morning coffee, you can reflect on what you want to achieve throughout the day and record it in ORI.
It could be a responsibility, like you just remembered it's trash day, or you know the floor needs vacuumed before guests arrive this evening.
It could also be a personal goal, such as hitting the gym or giving someone a compliment.
Think of Sprints like RUNNING towards a daily success.

### Tasks: priORItize

Tasks are non-urgent responsibilities with a real deadline.
This is the most general function of a to-do app.
You can record future tasks such as Christmas shopping, getting an oil change for your car, or filing your taxes.
This app can also function as a calendar app, reminding you about doctor's appointments, lunch with friends, and important birthdays.
Think of Tasks like WALKING towards an eventual success.

### Goals: memORIes

Goals are a little unique.
Instead of a single achievable item, Goals are meant to hold multiple Tasks and display them as a group.
This helps to make large, daunting tasks more manageable.
You can also use these goals to visualize the steps needed to achieve something great.
For example, hit your fitness goals by getting a gym membership, exercising thrice in a week (using Sprints to motivate yourself), and learning a new healthy recipe.
Think of Goals like HIKING.
It will take a lot of WALKING, but you'll eventually end up wherever you want to go.

## For My Fellows

Developing this app was a product of passion, but it was also an opportunity to learn how to develop android applications.
In this section, I'll be explaining some about the very basics concerning how the code is designed and how it works.
